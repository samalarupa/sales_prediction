#  Sale Prediction – Hybrid Sales Forecasting System

A production-ready **Sales Prediction system** that forecasts future sales for multiple products using a **hybrid machine learning approach**.  
The system is designed to deliver **accurate, business-oriented forecasts** even with **limited historical data**.

---

##  Project Overview

This project predicts **weekly sales for 800+ products** over a **2-year forecast horizon**, using only **52 values/product of weekly of historical data**.  
To overcome data constraints, a **Hybrid Ensemble Model** is used:

- **Facebook's Prophet** for trend (adaptive Linear & Logistic curves) and seasonality (recurring patterns) detection
- **LightGBM** for learning global correction patterns and Final Ensemble Model

This approach combines **time-series forecasting of Prophet** with **machine learning intelligence of LightGBM**.

---

##  Objectives

- Forecast sales accurately with short historical data
- Handle zero and intermittent sales
- Provide business-relevant evaluation metrics
- Support batch forecasting and live retraining
- Enable scalable deployment using APIs

---

##  Model Architecture

### Level 1: Facebook Prophet
- Captures yearly seasonality and trend
- Handles missing values and noisy data
- Suitable for short time-series datasets

### Level 2: LightGBM
- Uses Prophet predictions as features
- Learns cross-product and global sales patterns
- Corrects Prophet prediction errors

---

##  Data Pipeline

1. Convert wide-format sales data to long format
2. Apply log transformation to stabilize variance
3. Generate cyclical time features (week/month)
4. Encode product identifiers
5. Train hybrid model
6. Store forecasts and metrics in database

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **WMAPE (Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
- **Business Accuracy = 1 − WMAPE**

Metrics are selected to reflect **real business impact**.
